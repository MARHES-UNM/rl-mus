# Reinforcement Multi-UAV sim

Mostly taken from master's thesis [Autonomous Navigation and Tracking of Dynamic Surface Targets On-board a Computationally Impoverished Aerial Vehicle](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/selbystorage/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WCSelbyMSThesisFinal.pdf) By William Clayton Selby


The repository uses a trajectory planner of a quintic function. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_function

this paper shows how to model a quadrotor using eular lagrange equations.

they also added Aerodynamical effects to the equation.
